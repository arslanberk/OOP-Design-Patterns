We classify design patterns by two criteria. The first criterion, called **purpose**, reflects what a pattern does. Patterns can have either **creational**,**structural**, or **behavioral** purpose. `Creational patterns` concerns the process of object creation. `Structural patterns` deal with the composition of classes or objects. `Behavioral patterns`characterize the ways in which classes or objects interact and distribute responsibility.

The second criterion, called **scope**, specifies whether the pattern applies primarily to classes or to objects. `Class patterns` deal with relationships between classes and their subclasses. These relationships are established through inheritance, so they are static-fixed at compile-time. `Object patterns` deal with object relationships, which can be changed at run-time and are more dynamic.

|Design Pattern|Description|
|--------------|-----------|
|[Abstract Factory](<../2 Design Pattern Catalog and Sample Codes/2.1 Creational Patterns/2.1.1 Abstract Factory/Abstract Factory.md>)|Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.|
|[Adapter](<../2 Design Pattern Catalog and Sample Codes/2.2 Structural Patterns/2.2.1 Adapter/Adapter.md>)|Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.|
|[Bridge](<../2 Design Pattern Catalog and Sample Codes/2.2 Structural Patterns/2.2.2 Bridge/Bridge.md>)|Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.|
|[Builder](<../2 Design Pattern Catalog and Sample Codes/2.1 Creational Patterns/2.1.2 Builder/Builder.md>)|Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.|
|[Chain of Responsibility](<../2 Design Pattern Catalog and Sample Codes/2.3 Behavioral Patterns/2.3.1 Chain of Responsibility/Chain of Responsibility.md>)|Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.|
|[Command](<../2 Design Pattern Catalog and Sample Codes/2.3 Behavioral Patterns/2.3.2 Command/Command.md>)|Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support un-doable operations.|
|[Composite](<../2 Design Pattern Catalog and Sample Codes/2.2 Structural Patterns/2.2.3 Composite/Composite.md>)|Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.|
|[Decorator](<../2 Design Pattern Catalog and Sample Codes/2.2 Structural Patterns/2.2.4 Decorator/Decorator.md>)|Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to sub-classing for extending functionality.|
|[Facade](<../2 Design Pattern Catalog and Sample Codes/2.2 Structural Patterns/2.2.5 Facade/Facade.md>)|Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.|
|[Factory Method](<../2 Design Pattern Catalog and Sample Codes/2.1 Creational Patterns/2.1.3 Factory Method/Factory Method.md>)|Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.|
|[Flyweight](<../2 Design Pattern Catalog and Sample Codes/2.2 Structural Patterns/2.2.6 Flyweight/Flyweight.md>)|Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently|
|[Interpreter](<../2 Design Pattern Catalog and Sample Codes/2.3 Behavioral Patterns/2.3.3 Interpreter/Interpreter.md>)|Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language.|
|[Iterator](<../2 Design Pattern Catalog and Sample Codes/2.3 Behavioral Patterns/2.3.4 Iterator/Iterator.md>)|Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.|
|[Mediator](<../2 Design Pattern Catalog and Sample Codes/2.3 Behavioral Patterns/2.3.5 Mediator/Mediator.md>)|Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently.|
|[Memento](<../2 Design Pattern Catalog and Sample Codes/2.3 Behavioral Patterns/2.3.6 Memento/Memento.md>)|Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later.|
|[Observer](<../2 Design Pattern Catalog and Sample Codes/2.3 Behavioral Patterns/2.3.7 Observer/Observer.md>)|Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.|
|[Prototype](<../2 Design Pattern Catalog and Sample Codes/2.1 Creational Patterns/2.1.4 Prototype/Prototype.md>)|Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.|
|[Proxy](<../2 Design Pattern Catalog and Sample Codes/2.2 Structural Patterns/2.2.7 Proxy/Proxy.md>)|Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.|
|[Singleton](<../2 Design Pattern Catalog and Sample Codes/2.1 Creational Patterns/2.1.5 Singleton/Singleton.md>)|Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.|
|[State](<../2 Design Pattern Catalog and Sample Codes/2.3 Behavioral Patterns/2.3.8 State/State.md>)|Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.|
|[Strategy](<../2 Design Pattern Catalog and Sample Codes/2.3 Behavioral Patterns/2.3.9 Strategy/Strategy.md>)|Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.|
|[Template Method](<../2 Design Pattern Catalog and Sample Codes/2.3 Behavioral Patterns/2.3.10 Template Method/TemplateMethod.md>)|Define skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.|
|[Visitor](<../2 Design Pattern Catalog and Sample Codes/2.3 Behavioral Patterns/2.3.11 Visitor/Visitor.md>)|Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.|
